## Numpy
- NumPy is a fundamental Python library for numerical computing, providing powerful data structures and functions to handle and process large datasets efficiently.
-  It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing due to its capabilities with arrays, linear algebra, and other mathematical operations.
- Key Features
    -  N-Dimensional Arrays
    - Mathematical Operations
    - Broadcasting
    - Integration with Other Libraries
    -  Random Number Generation
    - Efficient Memory Usage
- NumPy arrays are preferred for numerical operations and large datasets due to their speed, memory efficiency, and extensive functionality,
- while lists are more versatile for general-purpose use with mixed data types.
