## Numpy
- NumPy is a fundamental Python library for numerical computing, providing powerful data structures and functions to handle and process large datasets efficiently.
-  It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing due to its capabilities with arrays, linear algebra, and other mathematical operations.
-    Key Features
    -  N-Dimensional Arrays: At the core of NumPy is the ndarray object, an N-dimensional array for handling data in various shapes and dimensions.
    - Mathematical Operations: Perform element-wise operations and linear algebra functions efficiently, often replacing the need for traditional Python loops.
    - Broadcasting: Enables operations on arrays of different shapes, making it easy to perform operations without needing to reshape arrays explicitly.
    - Integration with Other Libraries: Compatible with other popular libraries, including Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib, making it essential for data manipulation and analysis workflows.
    -  Random Number Generation: Supports random sampling and distributions, which is useful in simulations and machine learning applications.
    - Efficient Memory Usage: Optimized for fast computation with minimal memory footprint, crucial for handling large datasets.
